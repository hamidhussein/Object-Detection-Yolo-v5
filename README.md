# Object-Detection-Yolo-v5
Implemented the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection model to precisely locate and classify turns and unexpected road conditions in images.
# Project Overview
This project aims to develop an object detection model to identify various road conditions and turns in images captured on roads in Gilgit. The model is trained using a dataset of road images collected from different loactions of GB. The primary focus is to detect right turns, left turns, straight roads, and unexpected road conditions such as landslides.
# Project Objectives
Gatherd a dataset of road images in Gilgit
Annotated and labeled the collected data with information about road conditions and turns.
Trained a classifier to categorize images into predefined classes: right turn, left turn, straight, and unexpected.
Implemented the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection model to precisely locate and classify turns and unexpected road conditions in images.
After Evaluation  the model's performance  did a fine-tuning
